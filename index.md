# About

I am a third-year NSF Postdoc at Harvard University, working with [Mike Hopkins](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~mjh/){:target="_blank"}. Prior to that, I was a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, where I was co-advised by [Mona Merling]() and [Kirsten Wickelgren]().

My CV is [here]().

I work somewhere between algebraic geometry and algebraic topology, primarily in enumerative algebraic geometry and its enriched invariants. [More about my research here]()

In Spring 2026 I am teaching [MATH231br](), a second-semester grad course in algebraic topology - we're doing a Hirzebruch-flavored study of the topology of algebraic manifolds. Notes are being [updated regularly on GitHub](), and comments are very welcome!
