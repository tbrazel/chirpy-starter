My research is vaguely at the interface of algebraic geometry and algebraic topology. Some topics I love include: homotopy theory, enumerative algebraic geometry,

## Equivariant enumerative geometry
We study how symmetry manifests in (a) counting solutions to enumerative problems and (b) *solving* for solutions in terms of parameters. This work borders equivariant algebraic topology, Hodge theory and hyperbolic geometry, and numerical algebraic geometry.
